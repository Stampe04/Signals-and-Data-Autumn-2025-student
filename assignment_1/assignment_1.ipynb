That might sound vague, but just imagine that some other poor sod will have to read your code at some point, and easily readable, understandable code, will go a long way to making their life easier.

While making this exercise, a TA ran training with the original size of $224\\times 224$ and thereafter downsized to $60\\times 60$, both models were run for for one epoch. In the case of the downsized images, accuracy was $\\approx 0.47$ as opposed to $\\approx 0.28$ without downsizing. Try to replicate these results and explain why this might be the case.**\n",
